# Ranking app (XAMPP guide)

If you're going to use XAMPP, you only need the source code files from the app folder (the folder this README resides in)

## Launch web app

This app can only be launched locally.

### 1. Install XAMPP

Get the XAMPP installer from https://www.apachefriends.org/.

During the installation you can select which components to download. Ensure you install MySQL. PhpMyAdmin might also come in handy, but is not necessary (See image).

### 2. Clone/download repository

Clone or download this repository and place it somewhere inside the _document root directory_, which on Windows is:

```
C:/XAMPP/htdocs/
```

### 3. Import ranking_app.sql to your MySQL Server

You can use PhpMyAdmin or command line interfaces to deal with this.

#### Using PhpMyAdmin

##### Connect to MySQL Server

In XAMPP control panel app, start the Apache and MySQL services.

Click the “admin” button at the same row as “MySQL” (see image).

This will connect you to the MySQL server automatically (using the login credentials provided in `C:/xampp/phpMyAdmin/config.inc.php`)

Click import and import the ranking_app.sql (`/database/ranking_app.sql`) file (see image).

#### Using Command prompt & MySQL Shell

##### Connect to MySQL Server

In XAMPP control panel app, start the MySQL service.
Run this command in the bin directory:

```
C:\xampp\mysql\bin>mysql -u root -p
```

Then type your password if you have any and hit enter.

##### import the database dump

While connected, you can import the ranking_app.sql by running:

```
MariaDB [(none)]> source C:/xampp/htdocs/*path/to*/Ranking-app/database/ranking_app.sql;
```

There's no need to create an empty database and use it before importing the sql file. The ranking_app.sql will create the database by itself.

### 4. Enable the right MySQL server sign-in

Since you're not using Docker, you have to disable the sign-in written for Docker and enable the one for XAMPP:

- Open this file in a text editor `Ranking-app/www/app/php/db_connection.php`

- As its comments suggests, disable the MySQL server sign-in code for Docker, and enable the one for XAMPP.

### 5. Insert your MySQL password

If you have set your MySQL password to something else than '' empty (which is default), you should update this line:

```
$password = 'yourMysqlPassword'
```

### 6. Open the app

Open a browser and enter `localhost*path/to/*Ranking-app/www/app`.

I.e. If you downloaded/cloned the app in `htdocs/pages/Ranking-app/www/app`, you should be able to open the app by entering this: `localhost/pages/Ranking-app/www/app`

You should see this (image):

## There's no list named 'wishlist'

This most likely means the app isn't connected to the MySQL server database.

If you have changed your MySQL username or password to something else than default (username='root', password=''), you will have to update the db_connection.php (`Ranking-app/www/app/php/db_connection.php`) file, so it uses your current login credentials.
